# Smart-Water-Heater
This is an IoT system assignment for the university course CPC357. The system replicates components of a Water Heater with two sensors, a Servo motor, and an LED. The sensors and actuators are listed below.
1. Infrared (IR) Sensor
2. PIR Motion Sensor
3. SG90 Servo motor

The IR sensor and motion sensor is responsible for detecting the presence of human and motions within the targeted detection area. While the LED is a visual element to visualize turning the water heater on or off. And the servo motor replicates turning the water supply on or off for the water heater.

The IoT device is also connected to the Google Cloud Platform to ingest data sent from the IoT device into MongoDB.
